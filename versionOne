Assume that this repository is completly working and tested 
So we will be pushing this version to main

As of now firstBranch has a featureOne which is not a part of main

So moving forward while merging firstBranch ->main firstBranch has to get all the latest changes from main and if in case there is no merge conflict then merge firstBranch to main
